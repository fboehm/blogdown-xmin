I need to estimate variance components for a linear mixed effects model. Specifically, I need to consider the model, from @zhou2014efficient: 

$$Y = BX + G + E$$ 
where $Y$ is a $2$ by $n$ matrix of (possibly correlated) phenotypes (for $n$ subjects), $B$ is a $2$ by $c$ matrix of allelic effect sizes (where $c$ denotes the number of alleles per locus), $X$ is a $c$ by $n$ matrix containing genotypes (or genotype probabilities), $G$ is a $2$ by $n$ matrix of random effects and $E$ is a $2$ by $n$ matrix of random errors, which are assumed to be independent of $G$. We specify the distributions of $G$ and $E$:

$$E \sim MN(0, V_e, D_k)$$ and $$G \sim MN(0, V_g, I_n)$$

where $MN$ denotes a matrix-variate normal distribution with mean, row covariance matrix (2 by 2) and column covariance matrix (n by n).
