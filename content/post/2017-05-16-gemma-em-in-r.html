<p>I need to estimate variance components for a linear mixed effects model. Specifically, I need to consider the model, from <span class="citation">Zhou and Stephens (2014)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = BX + G + E\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> matrix of (possibly correlated) phenotypes (for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> subjects), <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> matrix of allelic effect sizes (where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> denotes the number of alleles per locus), <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> matrix containing genotypes (or genotype probabilities), <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> matrix of random effects and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> matrix of random errors, which are assumed to be independent of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. We specify the distributions of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E \sim MN(0, V_e, D_k)\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[G \sim MN(0, V_g, I_n)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(MN\)</span> denotes a matrix-variate normal distribution with mean, row covariance matrix (2 by 2) and column covariance matrix (n by n).</p>
