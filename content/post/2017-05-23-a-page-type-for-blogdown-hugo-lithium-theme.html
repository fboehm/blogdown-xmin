<p>I didn’t like the fact that my ‘About’ and ‘Research’ pages included a Disqus section, as I don’t need comments on these materials. I decided to find a way to create pages - which are not blog posts - that don’t have the Disqus section. I’m using, as of right now, Yihui Xie’s hugo lithium theme, with a few small modifications that I’ve documented in my first blog post.</p>
<p>The Hugo <a href="https://gohugo.io/content/types/">documentation on types</a> is quite good. The <code>layouts</code> subdirectory for the lithium theme contains, by default, two subdirectories, <code>_default</code> and <code>partials</code>. Within <code>_default</code> are two files, <code>list.html</code> and <code>single.html</code>. I see that, in the file <code>layouts/_default/single.html</code> there is a line near the end of the file that says:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>  {{ partial &quot;disqus.html&quot; .}}</code></pre>
<p>Following the Hugo documentation, I created a subdirectory <code>layouts/page</code>. I then copied the files <code>_default/single.html</code> and <code>_default/list.html</code> to the new directory. I then edited the file <code>layouts/page/single.html</code> by removing the line that I highlighted above, i.e. the line with “disqus.html”.</p>
<p>I then created a <code>content/page</code> subdirectory and moved the Rmd files - that is, those Rmd files for my pages - to <code>content/page/about.Rmd</code>, for example.</p>
<p>I initially changed the <code>config.toml</code> menu items that link to my pages. I assumed, mistakenly, that the pages would be in <code>public/page/</code> directory, when, in fact they are in <code>public/</code>, for example, <code>public/about/</code>. Recognizing this, I undid my changes to <code>config.toml</code>. The site now seems to work as I desired - the pages have no Disqus section.</p>
<p>I forgot to say that I also copied the file <code>archetypes/default.md</code> to <code>archetypes/page.md</code>.</p>
