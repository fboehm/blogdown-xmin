<p>I am assembling a package that implements an EM algorithm. I want to think about how I know whether the code works. Certainly, we know that an EM algorithm requires that the likelihood be non-decreasing over consecutive iterations.</p>
<p>In looking at resources on testing, I found particularly helpful Karl Broman’s <a href="http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/assets/lectures/09_testdebug_withnotes.pdf">slides</a> on testing R code. Hadley Wickham’s book Advanced R has a useful <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html">chapter on testing</a>.</p>
