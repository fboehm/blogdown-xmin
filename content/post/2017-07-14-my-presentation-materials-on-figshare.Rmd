I'm trying to remember to post my presentation materials on figshare.com. You can find them by clicking on the figshare icon on my home page or by clicking [here](https://figshare.com/authors/_/2919734). Included is the [poster](https://figshare.com/articles/Event_Detection_with_Topic_Modeling_of_Tweets/3545468) that I presented yesterday at [PolMeth XXXIV](https://polmeth.polisci.wisc.edu).
