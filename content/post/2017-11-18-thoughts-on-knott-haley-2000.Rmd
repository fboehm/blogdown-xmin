## Overview

I've been reading @knott2000multitrait, an article that discusses methods for multivariate QTL mapping. I'm trying to pay special attention to their methods for testing the competing hypotheses of 1. close linkage and 2. pleiotropy for a pair of traits that map to a single genomic region.
