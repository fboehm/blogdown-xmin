## Overview

I am still learning `git`, despite the fact that I've been trying to use it for 3 or more years. Today I needed to stage deleted files (*i.e.*, files that I previously added to the repository). I tried 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add .
```

but I then saw, after typing 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git status
```

that the deleted files remained unstaged. 

A quick google search turned up [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492558/removing-multiple-files-from-a-git-repo-that-have-already-been-deleted-from-disk). I then changed directories to the directory that is the root, or source - I'm not sure of the proper term - for my repository, and typed

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add -u .
```

With the `-u` flag, I successfully staged the deleted files and, after committing, I had a clean working directory. Problem solved!
