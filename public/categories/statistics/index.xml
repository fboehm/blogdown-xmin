      <description>Overview I’ve been re-reading Knott and Haley (2000). I’m trying to pay special attention to their methods for testing the competing hypotheses of 1. close linkage and 2. pleiotropy for a pair of traits that map to a single genomic region.
 References Knott, Sara A, and Chris S Haley. 2000. “Multitrait Least Squares for Quantitative Trait Loci Detection.” Genetics 156 (2). Genetics Soc America: 899–911.

      <description>Overview I used much of the summer of 2017 to study linear mixed effects models. I’m writing this blog post to document my experience. Perhaps readers will find it useful in designing their study plans for mixed models.
I found particularly useful Sections 8.4 and 8.5 of Wakefield (2013). The author describes in detail a general framework for linear mixed models before venturing into likelihood-based inference for these models. Particularly appealing to me, and differing from works of many others, is the emphasis of Wakefield (2013) on being explicit about conditioning.</description>
