      <description>Overview I used much of the summer of 2017 to study linear mixed effects models. Iâ€™m writing this blog post to document my experience. Perhaps readers will find it useful in designing their study plans for mixed models.
I found particularly useful Sections 8.4 and 8.5 of Wakefield (2013). The author describes in detail a general framework for linear mixed models before venturing into likelihood-based inference for these models. Particularly appealing to me, and differing from works of many others, is the emphasis of Wakefield (2013) on being explicit about conditioning.</description>
