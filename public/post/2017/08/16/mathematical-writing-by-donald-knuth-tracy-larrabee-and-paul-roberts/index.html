<p>I recently applied for a peer review training program that the Genetics Society of America organizes. An advisor kindly agreed to write a recommendation for my application. In discussing the program application with him, he told me that most of what he knows about refereeing he learned from Don Knuthâ€™s book, <em>Mathematical Writing</em>. I decided to find a copy of the book. The publisher, MAA, says that the book is out of print. However, they offer a PDF of the book for $16. You can order it <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/ebooks/mathematical-writing">here</a>. While I would typically balk at paying $16 for a PDF, today I caved and bought a copy of it. I expect to find that it will be incredibly useful as I continue to develop as a writer and reviewer.</p>
