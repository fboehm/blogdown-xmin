      <description>I didn’t like the fact that my ‘About’ and ‘Research’ pages included a Disqus section, as I don’t need comments on these materials. I decided to find a way to create pages - which are not blog posts - that don’t have the Disqus section. I’m using, as of right now, Yihui Xie’s hugo lithium theme, with a few small modifications that I’ve documented in my first blog post.
The Hugo documentation on types is quite good.</description>

      <description>While browsing the internet, I stumbled upon Rstudio’s new package blogdown. I read posts from Karl Broman and found the the book that the package authors - Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas - freely share.
One tricky part of setting up the website involved the DNS settings. I bought the site fboehm.us through google domains. While the blogdown book provides instructions for DNS settings for other domain name providers, at the time I set up my site, they hadn’t written instructions for use with google domains.</description>
