      <description>Motivation My colleague Rene Welch brought to my attention a recent pre-print, “LiMMBo: a simple, scalable approach for linear mixed models in high-dimensional genetic association studies” by Hannah Meyer, Francesco Casale, Oliver Stegle, and Ewan Birney. The biorxiv preprint is at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/30/255497
The authors present a bootstrap-based strategy for fitting multivariate linear mixed effects models in genetics studies with up to hundreds of phenotypes. They use the model:
\[vec(Y) = Xvec(B) + vec(G) + vec(E)\] where G and E are independent n by p matrices of random effects and random errors, respectively; X is a \(np\) by \(p(f + c)\) block-diagonal matrix (with p blocks of dimension \(n\) by \(f + c\) on the diagonal) containing both the genetic marker data and the covariate values; B is a \(f + c\) by \(p\) matrix of covariate and allele effects.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Knott &amp; Haley (2000)</title>

      <description>Overview I’ve been reading Knott and Haley (2000), an article that discusses methods for multivariate QTL mapping. I’m trying to pay special attention to their methods for testing the competing hypotheses of 1. close linkage and 2. pleiotropy for a pair of traits that map to a single genomic region.

      <description>library(knitr) opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE) My goal is to translate the C++ code in GEMMA/src/mvlmm.cpp to mathematical notation and, ultimately, to R code. Zhou’s C++ code uses the gsl C++ library.
CalcXHiY C++ code Let’s examine the function CalcXHiY which runs from line 357-384 of mvlmm.cpp. I reproduce them here:
void CalcXHiY(const gsl_vector *eval, const gsl_vector *D_l, const gsl_matrix *X, const gsl_matrix *UltVehiY, gsl_vector *xHiy) { size_t n_size=eval-&amp;gt;size, c_size=X-&amp;gt;size1, d_size=D_l-&amp;gt;size; gsl_vector_set_zero (xHiy); double x, delta, dl, y, d; for (size_t i=0; i&amp;lt;d_size; i++) { dl=gsl_vector_get(D_l, i); for (size_t j=0; j&amp;lt;c_size; j++) { d=0.</description>

      <description>I need to estimate variance components for a linear mixed effects model. Specifically, I need to consider the model, from Zhou and Stephens (2014):
\[Y = BX + G + E\] where \(Y\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of (possibly correlated) phenotypes (for \(n\) subjects), \(B\) is a \(2\) by \(c\) matrix of allelic effect sizes (where \(c\) denotes the number of alleles per locus), \(X\) is a \(c\) by \(n\) matrix containing genotypes (or genotype probabilities), \(G\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of random effects and \(E\) is a \(2\) by \(n\) matrix of random errors, which are assumed to be independent of \(G\).</description>
