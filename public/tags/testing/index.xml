      <description>I like to use Travis CI with my R packages. I recently wrote a R package, limmbo2, that is a wrapper for the python module limmbo. I used the R package reticulate, from Rstudio. I struggled for about 3 hours to write a .travis.yml file for limmbo2. Finally, I found a viable solution. I’m writing this blog post in hopes that it might be useful to myself and others in the future.</description>

      <description>I am assembling a package that implements an EM algorithm. I want to think about how I know whether the code works. Certainly, we know that an EM algorithm requires that the likelihood be non-decreasing over consecutive iterations.
In looking at resources on testing, I found particularly helpful Karl Broman’s slides on testing R code. Hadley Wickham’s book Advanced R has a useful chapter on testing.</description>
